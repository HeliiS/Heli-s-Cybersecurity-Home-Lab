# KQL Security Log Insights

This project demonstrates how to analyze mock security log data using Kusto Query Language (KQL). It simulates real-world scenarios like login attempts, failures, and session durations, visualized using charts.

## Use Cases
- Count failed login attempts
- Detect login bursts over time
- Visualize user activity
- Understand security incident trends
